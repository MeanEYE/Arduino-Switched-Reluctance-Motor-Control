/**
 * Switched Reluctance Motor Control
 * Copyright Â© 2017 Mladen Mijatov. All Rights Reserved.
 *
 * This simple library allows control of switch reluctance motors such
 * as those found in hard disks. It provides varying degrees of precision
 * assuming three phases.
 *
 * Library also supports rudimentary speed control which allows programmers
 * to control motor speed without resorting to usage of `delay`. This is done
 * through setting speed measured in revolutions per minute and calling
 * `motor_step` or `motor_step_backward` frequently. State of pins will be
 * updated only after specific time has passed. Speed control does take into
 * account sequence sizes, so no additional calculation is needed.
 *
 *
 * Please note that:
 *
 * - You should *not* connect motor contacts directly to your micro-controller
 *   as they use much higher current than what your controller can provide and
 *   will most likely result in a damaged hardware. Instead you should come up
 *   with indirect solution such as one with transistors or optocoupler;
 *
 * - You can have multiple different sequences using the same pins. However be
 *   careful when switching between the two while motor is running as you might
 *   cause motor to stall. Ideally you should synchronize when `position == 1`;
 *
 * - Avoid setting `position` manually. It's not a typical counter. Library is
 *   stepping through sequence by shifting a single bit to the left or right;
 *
 * - Calling `motor_release` will stop applying any voltage to configured pins
 *   but phase will continue to cycle. Calling `motor_resume` again will
 *   resume applying voltage to pins. This is useful if you wish to spin up
 *   the motor and let it run on its own for a while.
